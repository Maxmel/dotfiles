The particular algorithm is quite\nsimilar to `djb2`, by Dan Bernstein and available\n[here](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html). Differences include iterating\nover the string *backwards* (as that is faster in JavaScript) and using the XOR\noperator instead of the addition operator (as described at that page and\nbecause it obviates the need for modular arithmetic in JavaScript).\n\nThe hashing function returns a number between 0 and 4294967295 (inclusive).\n\nThanks to [cscott](https://github.com/cscott) for reminding us how integers\nwork in JavaScript.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nTo the extend possible by law, The Dark Sky Company, LLC has [waived all\ncopyright and related or neighboring rights][cc0] to this library.\n\n[cc0]: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n","maintainers":[{"name":"darkskyapp","email":"devsupport@darkskyapp.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-11-28T13:45:06.049Z","created":"2012-11-20T15:10:40.757Z","1.1.0":"2012-11-20T15:10:42.180Z","1.1.1":"2016-11-28T13:45:06.049Z"},"author":{"name":"The Dark Sky Company","email":"devsupport@darkskyapp.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/darkskyapp/string-hash.git"},"users":{"fgribreau":true,"eterna2":true,"wenbing":true},"keywords":["string","hashing"],"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/darkskyapp/string-hash#readme","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/darkskyapp/string-hash/issues"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"583c34e2-dba\"","_lastModified":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 13:45:06 GMT"}
